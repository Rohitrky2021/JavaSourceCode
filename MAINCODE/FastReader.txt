FastReader---------->   long nextLong(): Reads the next token from the input stream and parses it as a long integer.
                        double nextDouble(): Reads the next token from the input stream and parses it as a double.
                        String nextLine(): Reads the next line from the input stream and returns it as a string.
                        int[] nextIntArray(int n): Reads the next n tokens from the input stream and stores them as an array of integers.
                        Integer[] nextIntegerArray(int n): Reads the next n tokens from the input stream and stores them as an array of Integers (wrapper class for int).
                        long[] nextLongArray(int n): Reads the next n tokens from the input stream and stores them as an array of long integers.
                        String[] nextStringArray(): Reads the next line from the input stream and splits it into an array of strings using space as the delimiter.
