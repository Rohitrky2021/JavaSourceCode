## soldier is craving bananas

A soldier is craving bananas and wants to buy \( w \) bananas from a shop. 
The price of bananas increases in a specific pattern: the first banana costs \( k \) dollars, 
the second banana costs \( 2k \) dollars, the third banana costs \( 3k \) dollars, and so on.
 In general, the \( i \)-th banana costs \( i \cdot k \) dollars.

The soldier has \( n \) dollars initially
. Your task is to help the soldier determine how many dollars he needs to borrow from his friend to buy all \( w \) bananas.

### Constraints
\( 1 \le k, w \le 1000 \)
\( 0 \le n \le 10^9 \)

### Input
The first line contains three positive integers \( k \), \( n \), and \( w \):

- \( k \): the cost of the first banana.
- \( n \): the initial number of dollars the soldier has.
- \( w \): the number of bananas he wants to buy.

### Output
Output one integer â€” the amount of dollars that the soldier must borrow from his friend. If he doesn't have to borrow money, output 0.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
3 17 4
```
**Output:**
```
13
```

Help the soldier figure out how much money he needs to borrow to satisfy his banana craving!
