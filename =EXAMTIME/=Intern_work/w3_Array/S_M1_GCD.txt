## magical world of algorithms

In the magical world of algorithms, there's a wise turtle who loves solving puzzles involving arrays. 
One day, the turtle comes across a unique challenge. Given an array \(a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\),
 the turtle must determine whether it's possible to rearrange its elements 
 into another array \(b = [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n]\) such that the modulo operation performed
  sequentially on \(b\)'s elements never results in zero.

Here’s what the turtle needs to achieve:

Calculate the result of the operation \(b_1 \mod b_2 \mod \ldots \mod b_n \neq 0\).

The modulo operations are performed from left to right. For example, for an array \(b\) and 
operations \(2024 \mod 1000 \mod 8\), it would be calculated as \((2024 \mod 1000) \mod 8 = 24 \mod 8 = 0\).

### Input
The first line contains a single integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.  
The first line of each test case contains a single integer \(n\) (2 ≤ \(n\) ≤ 10^5).  
The second line of each test case contains \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) (1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ 10^9).  
The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

### Output
For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to rearrange the array \(a\) into an array \(b\) such that \(b_1 \mod b_2 \mod \ldots \mod b_n \neq 0\). Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

### Examples

**Input:**
8
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
5
3 3 3 3 3
3
2 2 3
5
1 1 2 3 7
3
1 2 2
3
1 1 2
6
5 2 10 10 10 2
4
3 6 9 3


**Output:**

YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO


### Explanation

- In the first test case, rearranging the array into \(b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\) (doing nothing) results in \(1 \mod 2 \mod 3 \mod 4 \mod 5 \mod 6 = 1\). Hence, it is possible to achieve the goal.
- In the second test case, the array \(b\) must be equal to \([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\), which results in \(3 \mod 3 \mod 3 \mod 3 \mod 3 = 0\). Hence, it is impossible to achieve the goal.
- In the third test case, rearranging the array into \(b = [3, 2, 2]\) results in \(3 \mod 2 \mod 2 = 1\). Hence, it is possible to achieve the goal.
