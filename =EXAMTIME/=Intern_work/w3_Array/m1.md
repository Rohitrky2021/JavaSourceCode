## Story-based Problem Description

Vitaly loves to solve puzzles and has recently come across a curious challenge involving an array of distinct integers. He needs your help to complete this puzzle.

Here's the task: Vitaly has an array consisting of \( n \) distinct integers. His goal is to split this array into three non-empty sets, adhering to the following rules:

1. The product of all numbers in the first set should be less than zero (< 0).
2. The product of all numbers in the second set should be greater than zero (> 0).
3. The product of all numbers in the third set should be equal to zero (= 0).

Moreover, each number from the original array must be placed into exactly one of the three sets. Vitaly is confident that such a division is possible, and there could be multiple valid solutions. Your job is to find one of these valid divisions for him.

### Constraints
- \( 3 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- \( |a_i| \leq 1000 \)

### Input
The first line of input contains a single integer \( n \), representing the number of integers in the array.
The second line contains \( n \) space-separated distinct integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) â€” the elements of the array.

### Output
Your output should consist of three lines:

1. The first line should start with an integer \( n_1 \) (\( n_1 > 0 \)), representing the number of elements in the first set, followed by the elements of this set.
2. The second line should start with an integer \( n_2 \) (\( n_2 > 0 \)), representing the number of elements in the second set, followed by the elements of this set.
3. The third line should start with an integer \( n_3 \) (\( n_3 > 0 \)), representing the number of elements in the third set, followed by the elements of this set.

The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may print any of them.
