/*
 * Explanation-
 * 1. whatever we write in " " is printed in the output
 * 2. if we want to put anything in the output we write as system.out.println
 * 3. ; is known as a statement terminator which is written after every println code. If we forget to write this in the code then a
 * compilation error will come in the terminal when we run the program
