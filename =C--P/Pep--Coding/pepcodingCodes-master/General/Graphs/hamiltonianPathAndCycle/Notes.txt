Steps:

0. from calling function from main.. I have added src initially in psf.

1. for all unvisited nbr of src, call hamPath

for(Edge e : graph[src]){
           int nbr = e.nbr;
           if(!vis.contains(nbr)){
               hamPath(nbr, graph, vis, psf + nbr, osrc);
           }
           
       }


2. Mark and Unmark before calling
vis.add(src);



vis.remove(src);


3. Think for base case: 
We have used HashSet<> because we can take advantage of hs.size() it will give the count of visited vtx.
If we do not use the HashSet then we must use boolean vis and count of vis.

4. In base case we checked for cycle, if there is cycle then SYSO() accordingly. Or for path also print accordingly.
